**NowPlay-Box** is a simple **GitHub Action** built to make dynamic Gist displaying the album you're now-playing on **Spotify** .
<br>

## Usage
**To start, you need to prepare some things:**
- Create a new public GitHub Gist at https://gist.github.com/

- Create an Access Token with the `gist` scope and save it.
You can do that at https://github.com/settings/tokens/new

<br>

**After getting this done:**
- Fork this repository.

- Go to your fork's **Settings > Secrets** page add the following secrets:
	- **`SPOTIPY_USER_ID`** - Spotify Username
	- **`SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID`** - Spotify client ID taken from Spotify API
	- **`SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET`** - Spotify client secret taken from Spotify API
	- **`SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI`** - Callback URL for OAuth
	- **`GH_TOKEN`** - The access token you saved earlier.
	- **`GIST_ID`** - The ID of your newly created public Gist.

   *It will look like this:*  
	 `https://gist.github.com/RangerDigital/`**`hugecode`**.
<br>

**That's It!**  
Now every 10 minutes `schedule.yml` workflow will update your Gist
